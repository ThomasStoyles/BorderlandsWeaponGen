### Table of contents

# Introduction 
This project which has been set out by QA is to create an application that genetayes objects. THese will be set upon predefined rules. In this project thes objects will create a random gun from the game Borderlands. This will give you a manufacturer, gun rarity and elemental damage. These objects will be randomized however will be defined in some way.  

This project will involve the following skills...

* Project Management - Trello
* Version Control - GIT
* CI Server - Jenkins
* Configuration Management - Ansible
* Cloud server: GCP virtual machines
* Containerisation: Docker
* Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm
* Reverse Proxy: NGINX


# MVP (Minimum Viable Product) 

This project comes with a set of requirements that will need to be met to ensure completion of the project, also known as the Minimum Viable Product. 
These requirements are as followed...

* A Kanban Board (Trello) - That will have full expansion on tasks that need to be completed and, tasks that have been completed. As well as records of any issues that might be encountered and a risk assessment.

* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model - Created in Python, this application will have 4 services which will be following the requirements set on my Trello Board.

* CI Server - The application will be built through a CI server, in this case jenkins, which will be deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine. This will also have webhooks integrated so that the application is automaticlly redeployed when changed.

* The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture - This will be displayed below.

* containerisation and orchestration tool - The projec must be deployed using a containerisation and orchestration tool. In this case this will be Docker and Docker swarm.

* Ansible Playbook - This will provision the environment that my application needs to run.

* The project must make use of a reverse proxy.

Once all these requirements have been met the project will be complete.

# Architecture
The architecture for this project will be as followed...

Service 1 - This service will be the frontend of the application. This will be what the user sees and will be very basic.

Service 2 - This will be the first randomized value. For my project this will be types of manufacturers that can be drawn at random. 

Service 3 - This will be the second randomized value. For my project this will be a number between 0-105 which will then correlate to the rarity of the weapon which will be defined in service 4.

Service 4 - This service will be where everything comes together and will be sent back to service 1. In here we will have the numbers from service 3 be defined into groups so this number represents this rarity. In here we will also have a list of damage types which can be put on each weapon. 

# Planning 

### Kanban Board
For the project we had to create a Kanban board, for this I used trello. I used this board to track my progress throughout the application and was able to track what still needs to happen and what has been completed. Below are images of the trello board to help you see this process.
Here I am half way through the project
