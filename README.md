# Introduction 
This project which has been set out by QA is to create an application that genetayes objects. THese will be set upon predefined rules. In this project thes objects will create a random gun from the game Borderlands. This will give you a manufacturer, gun rarity and elemental damage. These objects will be randomized however will be defined in some way.  

This project will involve the following skills...

* Project Management - Trello
* Version Control - GIT
* CI Server - Jenkins
* Configuration Management - Ansible
* Cloud server: GCP virtual machines
* Containerisation: Docker
* Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm
* Reverse Proxy: NGINX


# MVP (Minimum Viable Product) 

This project comes with a set of requirements that will need to be met to ensure completion of the project, also known as the Minimum Viable Product. 
These requirements are as followed...

* A Kanban Board (Trello) - That will have full expansion on tasks that need to be completed and, tasks that have been completed. As well as records of any issues that might be encountered and a risk assessment.

* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model - Created in Python, this application will have 4 services which will be following the requirements set on my Trello Board.

* CI Server - The application will be built through a CI server, in this case jenkins, which will be deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine. This will also have webhooks integrated so that the application is automaticlly redeployed when changed.

* The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture - This will be displayed below.

* containerisation and orchestration tool - The projec must be deployed using a containerisation and orchestration tool. In this case this will be Docker and Docker swarm.

* Ansible Playbook - This will provision the environment that my application needs to run.

* The project must make use of a reverse proxy.

Once all these requirements have been met the project will be complete.

### Kanban Board
For the project we had to create a Kanban board, for this I used trello. I used this board to track my progress throughout the application and was able to track what still needs to happen and what has been completed. Within each heading on my trello board was a To-Do list with items that I had to complete before I would have completed the project. Below are images of the trello board to help you see this process.

As you can see in the trello board this is about half way through createing my project. The trello board has number on it these numbers I created depending on how hard I felt certain tasks will be. I also have had some issues with my project which I will go into more detail about further in this report.
