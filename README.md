# Introduction 
This project set out by QA will involve the following skills...

* Project Management 
* 

# Scope 

This project comes with a set of requirements that will need to be met to ensure completion. 
These requirements are...

* A Trello Board - That will have full expansion
on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.
As well as records of any issues or risks faced.

* A relational database - Used to store all data persistently, and
must have minimum of two tables within it. We are also required to 
model a relationship.

* Clear documentation - from a design phase describing the architecture
you will use for you project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment.

* A functional CRUD application - Created in Python, following best
practices and design principles, that meets the requirements set on
your Trello Board.

* Fully designed test suits - For the application created. As well as 
automated tests for validation of the application. You must
provide high test coverage in your backend and provide consistent
reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.

* A functioning frount-end website and integrated APIs, using Flask

* Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the
Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI
server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.

Once all these requirements have been met the project will be complete.

# Planning 

### Project Tracking
For the project we had to create a Kanban board, for this I used trello. I used this board to track my progress throughout the application and was able to track what still needs to happen and what has been completed. Within each heading on my trello board was a To-Do list with items that I had to complete before I would have completed the project. Below are images of the trello board to help you see this process.

As you can see in the trello board this is about half way through createing my project. The trello board has number on it these numbers I created depending on how hard I felt certain tasks will be. I also have had some issues with my project which I will go into more detail about further in this report.
